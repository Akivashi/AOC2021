Advent Of Code Solutions made using [.NET 6.0 LTS](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)

Disclaimer: These solutions might not be the best ones out there, but atleast i had fun creating them.

## How to run:

```
cd Day<#day>
dotnet run Program.cs <Optionally add the number of the assignment as the second argument, either 1 or 2>
```

## Setup from scratch:
```
cd CloneCodeSetup
dotnet run Program.cs
```
Note: creating these initial files will only create them if they do not already exist. The untilDay variable determines the amount of Day projects to generate.
